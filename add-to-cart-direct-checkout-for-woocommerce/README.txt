WooCommerce Direct Checkout aims to simplify the checkout process, leading to an immediate increase in sales. This plugin for WooCommerce allows you to redirect users to the checkout instead of cart page.

Direct Checkout allows you to remove other unnecessary things in the checkout process like the order comments, shipping address (pro), coupon form.

One Page Checkout – Reduce cart abandonment with our One Page Checkout option. One Page Checkout make easier for customers to buy from custom checkout pages by displaying both product selection and checkout forms on a single page. 

The whole idea working behind WooCommerce single page checkout is to reduce the lengthy checkout process.

== Make the Buy Now Button Work Like Amazon (PRO) ==

Let users quickly purchase a single product without affecting the rest of their cart. For example, if a user already has products X, Y, and Z in the cart and clicks "Buy Now" on product A, they’ll be taken to checkout with just product A. The other items (X, Y, Z) remain in the cart for future purchase.
